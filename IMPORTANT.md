# GymProjectUI
In the Admin Control panel DO NOT delete any user at the start
First view all buttons and THEN you can delete the user
(This is because there are 3 users set with 3 messages to to admin
Deleting one of them will remove all messages because of the connection between the 3)

I've updated one line inside the MainWindow.xaml project
The Grid image should show the main window image. 
If the program throws an exception on that line please replace the image URL
To: "/UserInterface/Images/MainWindow.jpg"

Thank you!
